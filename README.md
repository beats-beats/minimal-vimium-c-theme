# Minimal-Vimium-C-Theme
gruvbox themed vimium-C theme. But you can change css default colors to change the color scheme to your liking xqcLL
just copy the [thingy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beats-exe/Minimal-Vimium-C-Theme/main/vimium-c-min.css) and paste it in your vimium c config

Slightly incomplete but whatever I'll probably get around to fixing it later
