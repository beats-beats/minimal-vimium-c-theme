# Minimal-Vimium-C-Theme
gruvbox themed vimium-C theme. But you can change css default colors to change the color scheme to your liking xqcLL
just copy the [thingy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beats-exe/Minimal-Vimium-C-Theme/main/vimium-c-min.css) and paste it in your vimium c config

Still incomplete because I don't use find selection so I never get bothered to work on it further. I might make some documentation to help other make some changes I guess not sure.
